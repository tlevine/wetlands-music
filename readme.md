Data-driven music about wetlands
=======

Ideas

* Each measure is a week.
* Each measure has four beats of data-driven intensity.
  1. The first beat is the number of impact applications that week.
  2. The second beat is the number of mitigation applications that week.
  3. The third beat is the number of restoration applications that week.
  4. The fourth beat is the number of other applications that week.
* The melodies are smoothed series of the mean longitude, latitude and
    acreage for the week; the values are smoothed between weeks such that
    the mean value occurs between the second and third beats, and then
    they are discritized to make four notes per measure.
* I want some melody that is opposite the melodies I mention above. Maybe
    weather works.
